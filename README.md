**gen0WaLTER** is a simulation package for the full-scale WaLTER robot. It drives the robot with a classical full-body PD controller inside MuJoCo scenes for flat ground, rough terrain, and stairs. The package version is **0.1.0**.

WaLTER is a wheeled leg platform: four hip joints, four continuous knee joints, eight driven wheels, and a waist (`head_joint`) held at zero. Balancing, speed tracking, and skid steering are closed in code. A forward-speed integral counts meters the body falls behind `lin_vel_x`. Once that distance crosses a threshold, the knees spin about +Y and the legs climb the stall.

The primary use case is interactive playback. `scripts/play_pd.py` builds one of the four scenes and steps `FullBodyPdPolicy` in the Viser browser viewer or MuJoCo's native viewer. Velocity-task observations, rewards, and a terrain curriculum live beside the controller so the same robot description can support later reinforcement-learning work. That control package is not registered as an RL task.

## Key Features

- Full-body PD on hips, knees, wheels, and the waist, with gains collected in one dataclass file.
- Pitch leveling by splaying the downhill hips, and roll leveling by extending the inner legs.
- Wheel velocity tracking: `full_speed_command` requests the motor's maximum wheel rate, with proportional speed error on top, plus a skid-steer yaw loop.
- Integral tumble: missed forward distance spins every knee about +Y between `threshold` and `release`, then the knees settle forward onto the roll pose. The Viser motors tab draws the state as **lin vel integral (m)**.
- Four scenes: `flat`, `rough`, `rough-test`, and `stairs`, including a shortened rough grid with taller stairs.
- Checked-in full-scale MJCF (`walter_fs.xml`), with generator motors stripped and CubeMars DC motor actuators attached.
- Actuator datasheets and torque-speed curves in `motor_models`. Details are in [`src/walter_rl/assets/motor_models/README.md`](src/walter_rl/assets/motor_models/README.md).
- Viser joystick for forward speed, yaw rate, hip angle, knee angle, Tank Mode, and the tumble integral.
- Batched simulation through mjlab, MuJoCo Warp, and PyTorch, on CUDA when a GPU is present and on CPU otherwise.

# User Manual

## Prerequisites

| Requirement | Version / notes |
| --- | --- |
| Python | `>=3.12,<3.14` (the checked-in environment uses **3.13.13**) |
| [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) | **0.11.19** or newer (`uv_build>=0.12.1,<0.13`) |
| Operating system | Linux is the supported path. mjlab sets `MUJOCO_GL=egl` on Linux before MuJoCo imports. |
| GPU | Optional NVIDIA GPU. `make_pd_env` selects `cuda:0` when `torch.cuda.is_available()`, otherwise `cpu`. |
| Viewer | A browser for `--viewer viser`, or a local display for `--viewer native`. |

Pinned simulation stack (from `mjlab/pyproject.toml`):

| Package | Pin |
| --- | --- |
| torch | `2.14.0` |
| mujoco | `~=3.11.0` |
| mujoco-warp | `~=3.11.0` |
| warp-lang | `>=1.14.0` |
| viser | `>=1.0.27` |
| mjviser | `>=0.0.14` |

## Installation

Clone the repository and sync the lockfile. `walter_rl` depends on the vendored `mjlab` tree as an editable path source.

```bash
git clone [INSERT REPOSITORY URL HERE]
cd gen0WaLTER
uv python install 3.13
uv sync
```

`uv sync` creates `.venv` and installs `walter_rl` and `mjlab` in editable mode. CUDA and CPU PyTorch indexes are declared as optional extras on `mjlab` (`cu128` and `cpu`). The root project does not select either extra; the lockfile resolves the default `torch==2.14.0` wheel.

## Quick Start / Usage

Play the PD controller on flat ground. Viser prints a local URL when the server starts; open that URL in a browser.

```bash
uv run python scripts/play_pd.py --task flat
```

Other scenes:

```bash
uv run python scripts/play_pd.py --task rough --viewer viser
uv run python scripts/play_pd.py --task rough-test --viewer viser
uv run python scripts/play_pd.py --task stairs --viewer native
uv run python scripts/play_pd.py --task flat --num-envs 4
```

In the Viser **Twist** folder:

1. Check **Enable** so the sliders override the sampled velocity command.
2. Set **lin_vel_x** for forward speed and **ang_vel_z** for yaw rate. Lateral speed is locked at zero.
3. Leave **Tank Mode** checked to apply **hip_angle** and **knee_angle**. Unchecked, both commands are zero and the sliders keep their values. The knee servo uses `tank_actuator_kp` and `tank_actuator_kd` while the box is checked.
4. Leave **Tumbling** checked so the stall integral runs. The motors tab shows **lin vel integral (m)**. Unchecked, the integral is cleared and the knees stay on the roll pose.
5. Leave **Orientation** checked to level pitch and roll. Unchecked, those errors are treated as zero.
6. **Rated torque cap** and **Rated speed cap** hold the DC motors on the continuous ratings. Both start unchecked, so the peak torque envelope and the no-load speed corner stay in use.
7. Keyboard: **I** / **K** step forward speed, **J** / **L** step yaw rate. **Zero** clears the velocity sliders and the pose sliders.

Build an environment in Python when you do not want the viewer loop:

```python
from walter_rl.control.full_body_pd.env import make_pd_env
from walter_rl.control.full_body_pd.policy import FullBodyPdPolicy

env = make_pd_env("rough", play=True, num_envs=1)
policy = FullBodyPdPolicy(env)
action = policy(env.reset()[0])
env.close()
```

`policy` ignores the observation tensor. It reads the robot state and the `twist` command.

## Configuration

There is no `.env` file. Behavior comes from CLI flags, `gains.py`, and two environment variables read by mjlab.

### CLI

| Flag | Default | Choices / meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--task` | `flat` | `flat`, `rough`, `rough-test`, `stairs` |
| `--num-envs` | `1` | Number of parallel environments |
| `--viewer` | `viser` | `viser` (browser) or `native` (MuJoCo passive viewer) |

| Task | Scene |
| --- | --- |
| `flat` | Infinite plane. Terrain height scans are removed. |
| `rough` | mjlab velocity mix with WaLTER caps: pyramid slopes up to 0.45, waves up to 0.12 m, stairs up to 0.12 m. |
| `rough-test` | Same mix on every third difficulty row (0, 3, 6, 9), with stair step heights scaled by 1.5. The uniform-noise column is a random grid whose cell height grows from 0 to 0.3 m along the row. |
| `stairs` | Flat (15%) plus pyramid and inverse-pyramid stairs (6–18 cm). The curriculum holds an environment on the hardest row after it clears it. |

Play mode (`play=True`, which the script always sets) uses a very long episode, disables observation noise and pushes, and turns the terrain curriculum off for the run.

### Controller gains

Edit `src/walter_rl/control/full_body_pd/gains.py`. Each nested dataclass is one loop. Angles are radians, rates are rad/s, and linear speeds are m/s. Hip, knee, and waist actuator gains are applied when the environment is built, so restart the process after changing them. Tank Mode knee gains (`tank_actuator_kp`, `tank_actuator_kd`) switch as soon as the checkbox changes.

| Group | Role | Notable defaults |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `PitchGains` | Level torso pitch with hip splay | `kp=6`, `kd=0.4`, actuator `800 / 100` |
| `RollGains` | Drop the downhill inner wheels | `kp=8`, `kd=0.5`, `q_max=π/2`, actuator `250 / 30` |
| `VelocityGains` | Track forward speed on all eight wheels | `kp=15`, `full_speed_command=10` m/s, `wheel_radius=0.10`, extra speed clip `50` rad/s |
| `YawRateGains` | Skid-steer from `ang_vel_z` | `kp=5`, half-width `0.32` m, yaw limit `2.5` rad/s |
| `TumbleGains` | Integrate missed forward distance, then spin the knees | `threshold=0.6` m, `release=0.4` m, `cap=2.5` m, `leak=1` /s, `min_forward_cmd=0.9` m/s, `min_speed_error=0.6` m/s, `rate=3` rad/s |
| `WaistGains` | Hold `head_joint` at zero | `kp=2000`, `kd=50`, effort `288` N·m |

`sign` is `+1` or `-1`. Flip it if that loop runs away.

`make_pd_env` also accepts `device`, `gains`, `easy_rough` (one 2–4 cm rough tile), `lock_speed`, `lock_heading`, and `episode_length_s`.

### Integral tumble

`TumbleGains` is the stall loop. Its state is missed forward distance, in meters. The Viser motors tab draws that state as **lin vel integral (m)**, with the bar scaled to `cap`.

Each control step reads body-frame forward speed, `v_x`:

- When `lin_vel_x` is above `min_forward_cmd` and `lin_vel_x - v_x` is above `min_speed_error`, the state adds that speed error times the step `dt`. The integral grows only from a forward shortfall.
- Otherwise the state leaks toward zero as `lag * exp(-leak * dt)`. `leak` is in 1/s.
- The state is clamped at `cap`, so a long stall cannot leave a large tail. Keep `cap` above `threshold`.

A hysteresis gate reads that state after the update. Tumbling turns on above `threshold` and stays on until the integral falls below `release`. While it is on, every knee reference is captured at the measured angle and then advances at `rate` about +Y. Positive +Y drops the front wheel and lifts the rear. The knee position servo remains the inner loop. Tumble only replaces the roll angle.

After release, each knee continues forward at `rate` until it reaches the roll pose on the revolution latched from the spin reference. The latch is taken when tumbling ends, so a shin that passes the pose stays on that turn. Unchecking **Tumbling** clears the integral, the spin reference, and the settle. An episode reset does the same.

### Environment variables

| Variable | Default | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `MUJOCO_GL` | `egl` on Linux | Rendering backend. mjlab sets this before MuJoCo imports. Use `osmesa` on machines without EGL, or `glfw` for a windowed GL context. |
| `MJLAB_WARP_QUIET` | unset (`0`) | Set to `1`, `true`, or `yes` to hide Warp kernel compile logs. |

`.venv/` is the local uv environment and is omitted above.

## Component Breakdown

- **`pyproject.toml`** — Package `walter_rl` 0.1.0. The only dependency is the local `mjlab` checkout.
- **`uv.lock`** — Locked dependency graph, including PyTorch, MuJoCo, Warp, and Viser.
- **`scripts/play_pd.py`** — CLI entry point. Builds a play environment, wraps it in `FullBodyPdPolicy`, and runs Viser or the native viewer.
- **`src/walter_rl/assets/walter_fs/walter_fs.xml`** — Checked-in full-scale MJCF produced by `generate-walter --fs`.
- **`src/walter_rl/assets/motor_models/`** — CubeMars actuator datasheets and output-side torque-speed curves. See [`src/walter_rl/assets/motor_models/README.md`](src/walter_rl/assets/motor_models/README.md) for the catalog, curve, and how to add a motor.
- **`src/walter_rl/assets/walter_fs/walter_constants.py`** — Loads that MJCF, limits hips to ±70°, replaces wheel contact parameters, adds belly and leg contact bumps plus a torso IMU, strips generator motors, and attaches the hip, knee, and wheel motors from `motor_models`.
- **`src/walter_rl/control/full_body_pd/gains.py`** — Tunable PD numbers. This is the file to edit when a loop oscillates or runs away.
- **`src/walter_rl/control/full_body_pd/controller.py`** — `FullBodyPdController` writes the action vector: pitch hips, roll knees, integral tumble override, wheel speeds, and a zero waist command.
- **`src/walter_rl/control/full_body_pd/policy.py`** — Viewer adapter. `__call__` drops the observation and returns `controller.act()`. `reset` clears the tumble integral.
- **`src/walter_rl/control/full_body_pd/env.py`** — `make_pd_env` clones a velocity scene, stiffens the hip and knee servos, adds the waist position actuator, and can lock the twist command.
- **`src/walter_rl/tasks/velocity/config/walter_fs/env_cfgs.py`** — Flat, rough, rough-test, and stairs `ManagerBasedRlEnvCfg` builders: actions, commands, sensors, rewards, terminations, and play mode.
- **`src/walter_rl/tasks/velocity/mdp/rewards.py`** — WaLTER rewards: XY velocity tracking that does not punish climb `vz`, ride height, head level, wheel-wheel contact, and gated knee tumble.
- **`src/walter_rl/tasks/velocity/mdp/observations.py`** — Finite-safe IMU, joint, and height-scan terms, plus sine/cosine knee angles for joints that can wind through full turns.
- **`src/walter_rl/tasks/velocity/mdp/curriculums.py`** — `terrain_levels_hold_max` promotes by progress along the commanded direction and stays on the hardest row once it is cleared.
- **`mjlab/`** — Vendored simulation library (version 1.6.0 in this tree): manager-based RL env, MuJoCo Warp sim, terrain generator, velocity command with the Viser joystick, and the Viser and native viewers.

# Developer Notes

## System Architecture

The code splits into three layers.

**Robot description.** `get_spec()` loads `walter_fs.xml` and prepares it for mjlab. `get_walter_fs_robot_cfg()` returns an `EntityCfg` whose articulation is three DC motor groups from `motor_models`: position servos on `.*_thigh_joint` and `.*_thigh_shin_joint`, and a velocity servo on `.*wheel_joint`. Ratings, the torque-speed curve, and the extra joint gears are documented in [`src/walter_rl/assets/motor_models/README.md`](src/walter_rl/assets/motor_models/README.md). Training-time hip and knee stiffness is 20 N·m/rad. The PD environment replaces those with the stiffer gains in `gains.py` and adds a position actuator on `head_joint` that the RL scene does not include. The PD knee action is an absolute angle. The velocity-task knee action is a relative step of `0.03` rad, which cannot hold a loaded leg assembly.

**Scenes.** `env_cfgs.py` starts from mjlab's `make_velocity_env_cfg()` and retargets it to WaLTER. The action vector is hip position, knee position, and wheel velocity. A torso ray cast, a small body-height scan, a belly contact sensor, and one contact sensor per wheel pair feed the reward and termination terms. `walter_rl.control` is intentionally not imported by a task registry. `make_pd_env` is the composition root for the controller.

**Controller.** `FullBodyPdController.act()` fills one action row per environment:

1. Pitch PD on `projected_gravity_b.x` swings the low-end hips outward from vertical, then adds the joystick hip angle.
2. Roll PD on `projected_gravity_b.y` folds the downhill knees until the inner wheel is straight down.
3. The stall integral adds `lin_vel_x - v_x` while the forward command and the speed error are both above their floors, and leaks toward zero otherwise. Above `tumble.threshold` every knee tracks a `+Y` spin at `tumble.rate`. Below `tumble.release` the knees settle forward onto the roll pose on the latched turn. See [Integral tumble](#integral-tumble).
4. Wheels scale `lin_vel_x` so `full_speed_command` requests the motor's maximum wheel rate, add proportional speed error, and add a differential from the yaw-rate loop.
5. The waist column is written to zero.

`FullBodyPdPolicy` matches the viewer policy protocol (`reset` and `__call__`). Simulation steps run in PyTorch on the device chosen by `make_pd_env`. The native viewer copies one environment's state back to CPU `MjData` for MuJoCo's passive window. Viser renders through `mjviser`.

## Development Setup

Install the editable checkout and run the play script under the debugger or from a terminal:

```bash
uv sync
uv run python scripts/play_pd.py --task flat --num-envs 1
```

`uv sync` installs both packages in editable mode (`walter_rl` from `src/`, `mjlab` from `mjlab/`). Changes under `src/walter_rl` and `mjlab/src/mjlab` apply on the next process start. Warp compiles kernels on first launch; set `MJLAB_WARP_QUIET=1` to suppress that log.

There is no database and no separate compile step. Attach a Python debugger to `scripts/play_pd.py`. For a headless check that does not open a viewer, construct `make_pd_env(..., play=False)` and call `policy` once, then `env.close()`.

## Testing

This repository has no test suite, no `tests/` directory, and no test dependency in `pyproject.toml`. Nothing in the project is wired to pytest, unittest discovery, or a CI workflow.

## Contributing & Future Work

There is no `CONTRIBUTING` guide and no remote is recorded in this workspace. A practical change is a focused edit plus a play session on `flat` and one uneven task (`rough` or `stairs`):

1. Fork or branch from `[INSERT REPOSITORY URL HERE]`.
2. Keep controller numbers in `gains.py`. Keep scene layout in `env_cfgs.py`.
3. Run `uv run python scripts/play_pd.py --task flat` and one of `--task rough` or `--task stairs`.
4. Open a pull request against `[INSERT DEFAULT BRANCH HERE]`.

No `TODO` or `FIXME` comments are in `src/walter_rl` or `scripts/`. The open product gaps visible from the code are:

- The velocity MDP (actor/critic observations, rewards, terrain curriculum, command curriculum stages at step 0 and step `5000 * 24`) is configured, but no training script or `mjlab.tasks` entry point registers it.
- `src/walter_rl/control/__init__.py` states that the RL task registry does not import the PD package. A learned policy would be a separate entry point.
- `mjlab/src/mjlab/utils/lab_api/math.py` and `mjlab/src/mjlab/utils/spec.py` each contain an upstream note to double-check a quaternion product and a spec helper. Those are inside the vendored library, not WaLTER task code.
- License, CI, and an automated test suite are not in the tree. Build-status and license badges above are placeholders until those exist.
